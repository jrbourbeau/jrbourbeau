# Hi!

I'm a software engineer and open source community member. Most of my coding activities centers around the Python data science stack. In particular, I'm a core maintainer of [Dask](https://dask.org/) and I work at [Coiled](https://coiled.io/) where I focus on scaling Python. Previously I studied at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I received my PhD in Physics.
