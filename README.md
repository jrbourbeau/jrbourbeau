# Hi!

I'm a solutions architect and open source community member. I work at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) where I focus on high-performance data processing. My coding activities largely center around the Python data science stack. In particular, I'm a core maintainer of [Dask](https://dask.org/).
